# task

A task is like a promise with pause/resume/cancel/progress mecanism.  
It's one of the most wonderful thing in the world, yes, it is.

Inspired by https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md#all---promise

## Example

Increase the id of a JSON file containing `{"id": 0}`

```javascript
Task.pipe([
  function createReadFilePromise(path){},
  JSON.parse,
  function(content){
    content.id++;
    return content;
  },
  JSON.stringify,
  function createWriteFilePromise(content){}
], null, 'file.json');
```

## properties

Name  | Description | Default
----- | --- | ---------
state | Can be 'pending', 'completed', 'failed' | 'pending'
value | Value of this task | null
isPaused  | Boolean indicating if the task is paused | false
isCancelled | Boolean indicating if the task is cancelled | false
nextList | An array of tasks waiting for this one to cancel/complete/fail | null
previous | The task this one wants to become asap | null
completionTransformer | A function used to transform the completion value | null
failureTransformer | A function used to transform the failure value | null
weak | If true, useless references are removed once the task is settled (set to false for debug) | true

## Before going further

The term task state refers to the completed/failed/cancelled/paused state of a task.  
The term task chain refer to the chain formed by previous & nextList properties.  
**The task state is propaged on the task chain**

## cancel()

The task will never complete or fail

## pause()

The task completion/failure is ignored until task.resume()

## resume()

Reconsider task completion/failure. If the task has completed/failed while paused, it complete/fails immediatly

## complete(value)

Initiate the task completion with the provided value

## fail(value)

Initiate the task failure with the provided value

## adoptState(otherTask)

This task adopt the completed/failed state of otherTask, calling optional completionTransformer/failureTransformer

## become(otherTask)

This task mimic otherTask cancelled/paused state immediatly or completed/failed state as as soon as possible

## chain(task)

Add task to the list of tasks becoming this one

```javascript
var A = new Task(), B = new Task();

task.chain(B);

A.nextList; // [B]
B.previous; // A
```

## then(completionTransformer, failureTransformer, bind)

Create a task & chain it with this one. It also set the optional completionTransformer & failureTransformer properties.

```javascript
Task.complete('foo').then(function(value){
  return value + 'bar';
}).then(console.log); // 'foobar'
```

The returned value is used as completion value, note that completing to a task is the equivalent of chain()

```javascript
var task = Task.complete('bar');

new Task().then(function(){ return task; });
// is equivalent to
new Task().chain(task);
```

## fork()

Same as then() but prevent the created task from propagating his state to previous tasks

## Illustration of the difference between then() & fork()

```javascript
var A = new Task();
var B1 = task.then();
var B2 = task.fork();

B1.cancel(); // cancel B1 & A
B2.cancel(); // cancel B2
```

## Undocumented

- delay(ms)
- timeout(ms)
- spread(onCompletion, onFailure, bind)
- finally(onCompletionOrFailure, bind)

## Static function (helpers)

- Task.complete(value)
- Task.fail(value)
- Task.delay(ms, value)
- Task.all(iterable)
- Task.any(iterable)
- Task.race(iterable)
- Task.pipe(iterable, bind, initialValue)
- Task.map(iterable, fn, bind)
- Task.mapAny(iterable, fn, bind)
- Task.mapRace(iterable, fn, bind)
- Task.reduce(iterable, fn, bind, initialValue)
