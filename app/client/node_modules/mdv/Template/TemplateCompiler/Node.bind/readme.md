Node.bind
===========================

Allow nodes to have a single "binding" object per attribute name.  

## Requirements
- [NodeBinding](./NodeBinding)
- [AttributeBinding](./AttributeBinding)

## Node.prototype.bind(attrName, model, path)

Not supposed to be called directly, will log an error.

## Node.prototype.unbind(attrName)

If a binding exists for attrName his close function is called and he is removed from this node.

## Node.prototype.unbindAll()

Call unbind for each binding object of this node.

## Text.prototype.bind(attrName, model, path)

If attrName is textContent, creates a [NodeBinding](./NodeBinding) for the textContent attribute, else calls Node.prototype.bind with supplied arguments.  
It will unbind any pre existing binding for attrName

## Element.prototype.bind(attrName, model, path)

Create an [AttributeBinding](./AttributeBinding) for this attrName.  
It will unbind any pre existing binding for attrName.
