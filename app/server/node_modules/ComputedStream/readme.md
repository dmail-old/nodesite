ComputedStream
=============

ComputedStream is a Duplex Stream that maintains order of stream piped by ComputedStream.chain()

## Instantiation

```javascript
var ComputedStream = require('./computedStream');
var computedStream = new ComputedStream();
```

## ComputedStream.chain(stream)

First call expect stream to be at least Readable. The stream is piped to computedStream.

```javascript
var fileStream = require('fs').createReadStream('readme.md');
computedStream.chain(fileStream);
// it's almost the same as writing fileStream.pipe(computedStream);
```

Next call expect stream to be Readable & Writable.

```javascript
var iconvStream = new require('iconv').Iconv('UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-1');
var gzipStream = require('zlib').createGzip();

computedStream.chain(iconvStream);
computedStream.chain(gzipStream);
computedStream.on('data', function(chunk){
	// chunk is a buffer containing readme.md bytes encoded in 'ISO-8859-1' and gzipped, in that order.
});
```

## Error handling

If a stream piped to computedStream has no listener for the 'error' event, 'error' event is fired on computedStream

```javascript
computedStream.on('error', function(error){
	// error could come from fileStream, iconvStream or gzipStream
});
```
