Module Middleware
=============

The module middleware is responsible to provide module to the client.
It will respond to two type of request : Resolve Request and Module Request.

# Requirements
- File middleware

# Resolve Request
If the client requires a module like so :
```javascript
require('foo');
```

Depending of the context where this line of code resides the headers are set like so :

Context 				| x-resolve 	| x-resolve-parent
----------------------- | ------------- | -------------------
Index page 				| foo    		| /
A module at /module 	| foo 			| /module

When the server receive this type of request he respond with the following : 

Status 	| Response 				| Meaning
------- | --------------------- | ----------
200 	| A string				| The path where the module resides on the server
404		| 						| The module doesn't exist on the server
other   | Any					| Should be treated as an error

The path is resolved using Module.resolve()

# Module Request
A module request provide a 'x-module' header with the path of the module as value.
The server will resolve the provided path relative to the client folder and serve the corresponding file using the File middleware.
