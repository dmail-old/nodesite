Utilities to manipulate objects

## ownKeys(object)

Return an array containing own property names in object.

## eachOwnPair(object, fn, bind)

Call fn with bind as this for each ownproperty of object. The list of property is returned by ownKeys(object).  
fn will receive 3 args: (key, value, object):
- key is the property name
- value is the value of object[key]
- object is the object

## eachPropertyIn(array, propertyIterator, fn, bind)

Too complicated to be explained :)

## appendPair(key, value, object)

Set value on object for the key property.

## append


## completePair



## complete


## implementPair

## implement

## complementPair

## complement

## eachPair
